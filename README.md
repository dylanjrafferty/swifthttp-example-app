## About

SwiftHTTP is a DSL that offers a declarative spin to networking and a simpler way to interact with the built in URLSession. This package offers a 
similarity in syntax to SwiftUI with the intention of making it very easy to read and write network requests just as views are within the bounds 
of SwiftUI.

This project aims to demonstrate possible use cases for SwiftHTTP and illustrate how it can be utilized in your project.
